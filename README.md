# E-Commerce Clickstream Funnel Analysis (Capstone)

**Owner:** Jordan  
**Case Study Title:** Optimizing E-Commerce Conversion Through Clickstream Funnel Analysis  
**Dataset:** Kaggle — “Ecommerce Behavior Data from Multi-Category Store”

## Goal
Quantify funnel conversion (view → cart → purchase), identify drop-offs, and diagnose revenue drivers by category and price band to produce practical conversion + revenue recommendations.

## Constraints
- Finishable in a couple hours
- Descriptive + diagnostic only (no ML/predictive)
- No scraping/APIs/infrastructure
- Max 3 dashboards, 10–12 slides
- Process: Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act

## Deliverables
- 3 Tableau dashboards (exported as PNG/PDF)
- 10–12 slide storyboard + final slide deck
- Case study write-up (structured, presentation-ready)

## Repo Structure
- `/docs` — charter, dataset prep, metrics dictionary, storyboard, decisions log
- `/tableau` — Tableau workbook(s) and notes
- `/exports` — dashboard PNG/PDF exports
- `/slides` — slide outline and slide assets

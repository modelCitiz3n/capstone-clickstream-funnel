## Dashboard 1 — Funnel Overview (Where users drop)
- KPI tiles: Views, Carts, Purchases, Total Revenue (purchase events)
- Funnel: View → Cart → Purchase with step conversion rates
- “Biggest drop-off” callout (absolute + rate-based)
- Filters: Month (fixed), Category (top N), Price Band (Low/Med/High)

## Dashboard 2 — Revenue & Category Performance (What drives money)
- Revenue by Category (ranked) + revenue concentration indicator (top categories share)
- Conversion by Category (view→purchase) to contrast “popular vs profitable”
- Price Band mix: Revenue and conversion by band
- AOV Proxy tile (clearly labeled “proxy” with definition in tooltip/notes)

## Dashboard 3 — Behavioral & Timing Insights (When to optimize)
- Hour-of-day trend: Views vs Purchases
- Day-of-week trend: Views vs Purchases
- Identify “high-intent windows” (high cart→purchase or purchase volume)
- Filters: Category or Price Band for timing comparisons
